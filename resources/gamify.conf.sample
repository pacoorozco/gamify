[datasource]
;
; Database settings:
;
; This section specifies the database connection that gamify may use.
;
; The "driver" property indicates what gamify database driver the
; connection should use. This is usually the same as the name of the
; database type, such as mysql or sqlite, but not always. The other
; properties will vary depending on the driver. For SQLite, you must
; specify a database file name in a directory that is writable by the
; webserver. For most other drivers, you must specify a
; username, password, host, and database name.
;
; Only works for mysql. NOT IMPLEMENTED ANY OTHER DRIVER!
