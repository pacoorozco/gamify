# gamify - The core of Game of Work!

## Presentation

gamify is the core of [Game of Work](https://gow.upcnet.es) application. It's a gamification platform created by **Emilio Ampudia** (eampudia _at_ gmail.com) and **Paco Orozco** (paco _at_ pacoorozco.info). 

This project was bornt while we were creating **Game of Work**, _aka GoW!_, a gamification platform in [UPCnet](http://www.upcnet.es). We wanted to teach, learn and share some fun with our colleagues, so we created a game work based on questions about our organization (process, services, teams...).

It's a PHP 5 application and you will need MySQL as a database.

As much as possible, we have tried to keep a clean code to work everywhere out of the box. You are not obliged to use our tools and are free to change the code in order to use it at your own feeling.
